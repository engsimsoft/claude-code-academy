# 📦 Claude Code Academy - Backup Strategy

## Overview

The Claude Code Academy employs an enterprise-level backup system designed to protect against data loss during development iterations. This system provides comprehensive protection for the stable MVP while enabling safe experimentation with new features.

## 🎯 System Architecture

### Components

1. **backup-system.sh** - Automated backup creation with git bundling
2. **restore-project.sh** - Interactive backup selection and restoration
3. **Automated cleanup** - Maintains 10 most recent backups
4. **Integrity validation** - Ensures backup reliability

### Backup Structure

```
$HOME/backups/claude-code-academy/
├── archives/           # Compressed project snapshots (.tar.gz)
├── git-bundles/        # Complete git history (.bundle)
├── metadata/           # Backup information (.json)
├── restore-scripts/    # Generated restore scripts (.sh)
└── backup.log         # System operation log
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Creating Your First Backup

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/claude-code-academy

# Create a backup
./backup-system.sh
```

### Restoring from Backup

```bash
# Interactive restore with backup selection
./restore-project.sh

# Restore to specific directory
./restore-project.sh ~/my-restored-project
```

## 📋 Detailed Usage

### Backup Creation Process

The backup system performs these operations automatically:

1. **Environment Validation**
   - Verifies git repository status
   - Checks required dependencies
   - Validates project structure

2. **Archive Creation**
   - Creates timestamped tar.gz archive
   - Excludes backup-related files to prevent recursion
   - Optimizes compression for storage efficiency

3. **Git Bundle Generation**
   - Captures complete git history
   - Includes all branches and tags
   - Enables full repository restoration

4. **Metadata Generation**
   - Records backup timestamp and system info
   - Tracks file counts and sizes
   - Documents git commit and branch state

5. **Restore Script Creation**
   - Generates custom restore script for each backup
   - Includes validation and safety checks
   - Provides standalone restoration capability

6. **Automatic Cleanup**
   - Maintains 10 most recent backups
   - Removes oldest backups when limit exceeded
   - Cleans up all associated files

### Restoration Process

The restoration system provides these features:

1. **Interactive Selection**
   - Lists all available backups with details
   - Shows creation date, git commit, and file counts
   - Allows easy backup identification

2. **Safety Confirmations**
   - Warns about destructive operations
   - Requires explicit confirmation
   - Shows directory contents if overwriting

3. **Integrity Validation**
   - Verifies backup files before restoration
   - Checks archive and bundle integrity
   - Prevents restoration of corrupted backups

4. **Complete Restoration**
   - Extracts project files to specified directory
   - Restores complete git history
   - Checks out appropriate branch

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Data Protection

- **Non-destructive backups**: Never modifies original project
- **Integrity checks**: Validates all backup components
- **Atomic operations**: Backup creation is all-or-nothing
- **Safe restoration**: Requires explicit confirmation for overwriting

### Error Handling

- **Graceful failures**: Provides clear error messages
- **Rollback capability**: Failed operations don't leave partial state
- **Logging**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting
- **Input validation**: Prevents invalid operations

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Backup Retention

To modify the number of backups retained:

```bash
# Edit backup-system.sh
readonly MAX_BACKUPS=10  # Change this value
```

### Custom Backup Location

To change the backup directory:

```bash
# Edit backup-system.sh
readonly BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/backups/$PROJECT_NAME"  # Modify path
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Maintenance

### Backup Health Check

```bash
# Check backup directory size
du -sh ~/backups/claude-code-academy/

# List all backups
ls -la ~/backups/claude-code-academy/archives/

# View backup log
tail -f ~/backups/claude-code-academy/backup.log
```

### Storage Management

Typical storage usage:
- **Project Archive**: ~50KB compressed
- **Git Bundle**: ~10KB (small project)
- **Metadata**: <1KB per backup
- **Total per backup**: ~60KB

With 10 backups: ~600KB total storage

## 🔄 Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Development Backup

```bash
# Before major changes
./backup-system.sh
git checkout -b new-feature
# Make changes safely
```

### Emergency Recovery

```bash
# If something goes wrong
./restore-project.sh
# Select recent backup
# Continue from safe state
```

### Testing Workflow

```bash
# Create test restoration
./restore-project.sh /tmp/test-restore

# Test changes in isolated environment
cd /tmp/test-restore
# Verify everything works

# Apply changes to main project
```

## ⚠️ Best Practices

### When to Create Backups

- **Before major feature development**
- **Before refactoring sessions**
- **Before dependency updates**
- **Before experimental changes**
- **At milestone completions**

### Backup Naming Convention

Backups are automatically named with timestamp:
```
claude-code-academy_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
```

### Security Considerations

- **Backup location**: Stored outside project directory
- **File permissions**: Scripts have executable permissions
- **Path validation**: Prevents directory traversal
- **Input sanitization**: Validates all user inputs

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Not in a git repository" error:**
```bash
cd /correct/project/path
git init  # if needed
./backup-system.sh
```

**"jq not found" warning:**
```bash
# Install jq for better JSON parsing (optional)
brew install jq  # macOS
sudo apt install jq  # Linux
```

**Backup directory permissions:**
```bash
# Fix permissions if needed
chmod 755 ~/backups
chmod +x backup-system.sh restore-project.sh
```

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Test backup system
./backup-system.sh

# Verify restoration
./restore-project.sh /tmp/test-restore

# Check git bundle integrity
git bundle verify ~/backups/claude-code-academy/git-bundles/latest.bundle
```

## 🎯 Performance Optimization

### Large Project Considerations

For larger projects, consider:
- **Parallel compression**: System automatically handles optimization
- **Selective exclusions**: .gitignore patterns are respected
- **Network storage**: Can be configured for remote backup locations

### Backup Speed

Typical backup times:
- **Small project** (<1MB): <5 seconds
- **Medium project** (<100MB): <30 seconds
- **Large project** (<1GB): <5 minutes

## 🔍 System Requirements

### Dependencies

**Required:**
- bash (4.0+)
- git
- tar
- gzip
- find

**Optional:**
- jq (for enhanced JSON parsing)
- numfmt (for human-readable sizes)

### Compatibility

- ✅ macOS (10.12+)
- ✅ Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+)
